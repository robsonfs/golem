# Golem

**Golem** is a tool written in Rust to help detect plagiarism between two documents. It uses the [Rabbin-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) to compare two documents and generate a plagiarism rate, as described in [this academic paper](https://www.ijstr.org/final-print/july2017/K-gram-As-A-Determinant-Of-Plagiarism-Level-In-Rabin-karp-Algorithm.pdf).
